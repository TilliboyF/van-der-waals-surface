# van-der-waals-surface

This is the code of my bachelor thesis: 'Van-der-Waals-Oberfläche von Molekülen'. The goal was to get the van-der-waals surface of molecules. Three moleculs got created:
- Water
- Methan
- Ethan

They can be found under /src.

## Setting up a virtual environment

create a virtual environment with:
```
python3 -m venv .venv
```
In the terminal, the environment can be activated as follows:

**Windows:**
```
myenv\Scripts\activate
```

**Mac/Linus**
```
source myenv/bin/activate
```

Install the dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run the Molecules
**Water:**
```bash
python src/Wasser.py
```
**Methan:**
```bash
python src/Methan.py
```
**Ethan:**
```bash
python src/Ethan.py
```
